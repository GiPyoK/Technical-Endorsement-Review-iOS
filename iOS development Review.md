# Technical Endorsement Review: iOS Development

The Technical Endorsement Review for iOS Development is similar to the industry interview process and includes a Code Challenge and Live Interviews. This is meant assess your mastery of iOS Development while simulating and preparing you for the interview processes you'll experience during your job hunt. You will receive scores across two components:

1. iOS Interview (Live Interview)
2. Code Challenge (HackerRank) and Code Challenge Interview (Live Interview)

To complete your Technical Endorsement Review, you must receive a passing score across all components.

### 1. iOS Interview

During the iOS Interview, you'll be asked to show your mastery of concepts from each of the iOS Development Sprints:

1. Demonstrate an understanding of Swift concepts through explanations of foundational language features.
    - suits well with OOP
    - automatically managed memory
    - safe (clear object types)
2. Explain basic iOS app architecture as it relates to navigation, data flow, dependency injection, and the MVC design pattern.
    - Navigation:
        - navigation controller,
        - tab bat controller
        - segues
    - Data Flow:
        - 
    - Dependency Injection:
        - protocols and delegates
        - It allows us to provide (or inject) object or data (dependencies) into another object
        - effectively test complex code with one or more dependencies
    - Model - View - Controller
        - 
3. Explain the importance of data persistence to create a consistent user interface/experience.
    - Data Persistence
        - Property List
        - User Defaults
        - Core Data
4. Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code and show examples of GCD and closures in the context of making network calls.
    - sync: in order
    - async: not in order
    - Grand Central Dispatch
5. Demonstrate practical uses of programmatic constraints for view layout and using the `draw()` method to build custom controls.
    - programmatic constraints
        - 
6. Explain the usefulness of Core Data as a persistence layer, show examples of data modeling/migration using the provided Xcode tools, and discuss the pitfalls and workarounds surrounding using Core Data with a multi-threaded application.
7. Explain the value of generics and provide examples for use cases in app development; explain concurrency in a general computing context, as well as the mechanisms in iOS that allow for concurrent programming.
    - race condition handle
        - lock
        - semaphore
        - Serial Queues
8. Explain the importance of automated testing and performance benchmarking and how they are accomplished in iOS apps.
9. Explain how third party frameworks are integrated into a project with dependency management and how design patterns are used in iOS development.
10. Demonstrate understanding of various media-related classes (audio, video, images, maps) for creating content rich iOS apps.
11. Demonstrate an understanding of Objective-C concepts through explanations of foundational language features.
12. Explain advanced Objective-C concepts like memory management and KVO/KVC.

**Possible Results**

- A passing score consists of scoring a two or higher across all objectives.
- Receiving a one on any objective(s) will be considered not passing.
